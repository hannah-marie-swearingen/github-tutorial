Hello! This is the testing repo for 599 where students will submit their test branch ðŸš€

This is Hannah Swearingen adding in some edits!

My FCOR 599 Project is completed on the behalf of Mudge Island Citizens Society (MICS) with open data. This project has compiled BC and Canada Open Data with local knowledge provided by MICS to assess fire risk based on fuel. Using the national fire risk map as a standard, this project recreates this process for the small island of Mudge.
